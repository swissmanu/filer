| -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FILER_ADDR`         | `:8000`       | A network interface and port where filer will provide its API and UI via HTTP.                                               |
| `FILER_INBOX_PATH`   | `./inbox`     | Path to the inbox directory.                                                                                                 |
| `FILER_DATA_PATH`    | `./data`      | Path to the data directory. Rule target paths are always evaluated relative to the data path.                                |
